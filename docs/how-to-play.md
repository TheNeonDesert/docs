# How to Play

The Neon Desert is a blockchain based game, requiring ~~real~~ crypto and a smart dApp browser. While we're in beta the game is operating on a FREE testnet, so you can play and explore without spending any money.

If this is all brand new, don't be too intimidated!
With this guide ~~and a few bucks~~ you'll be off in no time...

## I'm kinda new to this... dApp? smart browser? what even is an NFT...

dApps, or decentralized app, are programs that run on the blockchain. They look like regular websites but they allow you to interact with smart contracts, the code that power blockchain applications. To connect you need a special browser or plugin. We recommend MetaMask, it works great for both mobile and web.

A smart browser will include a crypto wallet, allowing you to send and receive tokens such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ingame Neon. It also includes a web-browser capable of sending these cryptocurrency tokens to smart contract, to execute code on the blockchain

If you're new to this we really recommend you only start with a few dollars, which is more than enough to dive right into The Neon Desert!

## How to Connect

The Neon Desert is on the current on the ethereum test network. You need to connect your Metamask to this in order to interact with dApps on that network

## How to get Neon

NEON is the base currency of the game and is used for all common actions. For now, we're giving free NEON tokens to any new wallets that connect to the game.

## Connect to the game

Lastly, you need to tell Metamask that The Neon Desert is allowed to request transactions. Don't worry, you still will review and approve every transaction where you actually send crypto. Click connect in game, notice that it doesn't cost anything or say anything weird, click approve on the tx popup
